Worked under direct mentorship from Eric Schmidt and Sebastian Thrun with grant-based funding.
- Built viral SwiftUI application for deep-faking friends via voice-cloning, lip-syncing, and movement. Used 3D-reconstruction and pose estimation/mapping, fine-tuned lip-syncing models to achieve viral UGC. Available on the iOS App Store (trystorm.app).
- Developed novel video-splicing, editing, and collaging algorithm, and integrated into a full-stack SwiftUI application delivered on the iOS App Store (memorie.app). Partnered with large TikTok and Instagram influencers for go-to-market strategy.
- Built LoRA fine-tuning library hosted on scalable H100 infrastructure, and full-stack iOS application to generate personalized, hyper-realistic images of users for social media apps. DateMax AI is pending release the iOS App Store (datemaxai-web.vercel.app).
