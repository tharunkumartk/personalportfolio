Wow. I can’t believe it’s already been an entire school year in ISM. Everything I’ve done this year in the field of Data Science has led up to this presentation. I went from just starting to learn Python and the idea of Artificial Intelligence to creating a whole Texas regionalization program based on energy consumption.

However, this speech is probably going to be the most difficult thing I have done yet. Honestly, it isn’t the time limit that I am having trouble with; it’s the energy level that I am feeling right now. Over the last couple of weeks, I have been sort of burnt out. Junior year has been stressful, especially due to SATs, ACTs, and AP classes, while participating in a plethora of extracurriculars. As a result, I consistently sound tired, which isn’t very entertaining to listen to. I truly am excited about the field I’m presenting, but my tiredness makes me sound like I don’t care. In fact, I had to re-record my rehearsal speech five times because I was unhappy with how dead I sounded (over 2ish hours of recording). 

So, my goal this week, is to try to become more excited about life and get my motivation back. If I am able to do this, I will definitely have energy, and my Final Presentation will go as smoothly as I had imagined a year ago.
