I’m excited. 

This week I managed to land a Data Scientist mentor, and I am extremely excited. I met him through a previous contact, and I had an interview with him. The interview went excellently, and I learned the importance of having knowledge in business in the Data Science industry. It turns out that not many Data Scientists know how to effectively convert business issues into Data Science problems and then back into business value. That means that my experience in business would be useful in this field. In addition, I learned that it’s important to learn the math behind AI models before actually using them because it helps you predict how it will work out. 

I am planning on doing further research in both of these subjects, but this week I also came up with an idea for a final product. 

My idea is to create an Artificially Intelligent algorithm for a nanobot to detect cancer cells. The only obstacle would be to get a hold of a contact in a bio-nanotechnology research center, but I think I might have a workaround for that. However, I will need to come up with other product ideas in case this doesn’t work out.
