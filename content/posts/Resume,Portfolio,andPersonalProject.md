I am up to date. 

During this week, I focused on updating my resume and personal portfolio. It turns out that my resume did not contain several of the accomplishments and experiences I gained over the summer. I worked as an intern as a part of a IBM and TransGlobal Technologies partnership subsidy known as TransGTI, and I learned a ton about Data Science in the real world. I made sure to include all of the details of the experience in my resume. I believe that it was a nice addition to my resume because it shows that I am showing real interest in the field. 

This week, I also attempted to recode my personal portfolio, but from scratch. I am trying to model it off of a neat example I found online, but it’s beginning to be significantly more difficult than I expected it to be, since I am not proficient in Javascript. However, I am taking this as a learning experience and I am forcing myself to finish the website before Sunday. Once I finish the website, I will have an invaluable skill that separates me from others: I am not only proficient in back-end Data Science work, but I can also effectively integrate it with front end tools, meaning I am a Full Stack Machine Learning Engineer. Just rolls off the tongue, doesn’t it?

My portfolio will be what I focus on next week, but I am pretty satisfied with the progress that I have made.
