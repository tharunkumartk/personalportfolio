Jan 19, 2021

The beginning of this week was relatively chill until Mrs. Altizer reminded me of something: since COVID-19 forces everything to be online, I can do interviews with people from other states. I talked to the previous person I interviewed and obtained one other connection with a Data Architect in Florida and scheduled an interview with him over the weekend. Although he wasn’t a Data Scientist, he was able to answer several general questions I had about the field. He also connected me to a Data Scientist that he knew (this person may be a potential mentor). I am having an interview with this professional tomorrow, and hopefully it goes well.

I am extremely excited for this interview because this would be the first interview where I can ask technical questions about Artificial Intelligence because that’s what this professional does for a living. But, we will have to see how it goes. 

On another note, my personal projects are coming on relatively well. Over the last week, I managed to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (basics), which will allow me to build an effective website. I also learned how to implement a code editor into the website, so all I have to do now is design the actual website.

Overall, I am sticking to my resolution to be more productive, in ISM especially. 2021 hasn’t been too bad so far.
