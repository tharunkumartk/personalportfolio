I feel like a kid again.

This week, I have been planning and completing my display board for the Winter Symposium. The name is kind of ironic, considering that the weather feels like its spring. I haven’t created any arts and crafts in nearly 3 years, particularly due to COVID, so planning out and creating such a display board brings a sense of nostalgia. I’m trying out a different style from the default “cut out letters and paste on board; I’m using the cutouts of the letters so that the actual letters end up being the actual board. I also used the same strategy for a variety of other shapes. As of right now, the display board is completed, but there is one small issue: my title is too long for the board. My solution for this issue is to just keep AI, and put my name next to it. Although this solution is a little bit lame, it gets the job done, so I’m not too disappointed. 

I also gave my 15-20 minute presentation this week, and I am somewhat proud of it. I did not rehearse the speech much, because I wanted to practice speaking on the spot, and I ended up doing exceptionally well in the speech. I didn’t talk too fast, nor did I fidget around like I usually do. The main component that I have left to add is a little bit of humor to the actual presentation. I can’t wait for the Winter Showcase, because I want to test out my Original Work on more people than just my friends.
