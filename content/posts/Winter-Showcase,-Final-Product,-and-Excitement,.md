Learning is one challenge, but teaching is a whole different breed.

This last week, I participated in my very first Winter Showcase, since last year’s was canceled due to COVID-19. It was a wild experience; most of the time, I’ve had to explain Artificial Intelligence to younger students, like high-schoolers, or I’ve had to explain it to more technologically adept adults. However, at the ISM Winter Showcase I had to explain the complex field to a wide variety of people, from older couples to actual Software Engineers. However, after the first couple of meets, I got the hang of it. The trick is to begin by asking questions to get an idea of the audience’s knowledge in the subject. After that, I was able to categorize each group based on how much they knew. Then, I made the information simple for the given category. 

However, throughout my time speaking to random people, I had a lot of downtime, where I thought about my Final Product. Based on how difficult and unrealistic my previous idea for my Final Product was, I decided on a new idea. I still wanted to utilize Computer Vision and 3D-models, but I didn’t want to utilize Natural Language Processing because the overall concept did not make that much sense. My new Final Product idea is to create a program that simply looks at 3D-objects and generates 3D-models for them. This could be used to develop cheaper alternatives to a variety of tools in a variety of different fields. I’m excited to see how this Final Product goes.
