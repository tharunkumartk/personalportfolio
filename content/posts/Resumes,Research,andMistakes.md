We had another week focused on the fundamentals of branding. 

We had another week focused on the fundamentals of branding. 

Earlier, we had to create a rough draft of what would be our final resume. I had tried my best to make a professionally designed resume, but it was still missing a couple aspects. I forgot to verify that my references were okay with me using them, so I had to remove them from my resume. I also forgot to include all of the specific extracurriculars and clubs that I was a part of. The reason I included those in my updated version stems from the ultimate point of the resume. The viewer has to be able to meet you. There is no way someone could meet and get to know me without them finding out about my extracurriculars because those clubs make up a major part of who I am. But, aside from that, I think my resume turned out pretty good.

After fixing up my resume this week, I began my research assessment over data structures. The two primary data structures used include RDBMS and Big data. I was unsure about when you would use one over the other, and I realized that I had to understand both of them in depth to be able to excel in Artificial Intelligence. This is because a major part of Artificial Intelligence is analyzing data to develop algorithms, and without knowing how to store and structure data, there would be no way I could possibly analyze it. The research that I did ended up being extremely helpful because I now understand the specific use cases of both of the data structures.

There is one last lesson that I learned this week; when I had to complete and submit my final resume and research assessment, my Wi-Fi stopped working. This meant that there was no way for me to complete and submit my assignment without it being late. The lesson I learned here was to not wait until the last minute to finish and turn in tasks, in case of emergency situations. This lesson will prove useful across the real world, and I hope that I don’t make the same mistake again.
