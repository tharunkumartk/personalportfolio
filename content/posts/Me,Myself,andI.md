Believe it or not, not many people know me. But those that do know me consider me as one of the most curious people they have ever met. The question I ask most is "why". because I like wondering about the world. My personal goal in life is to learn as much as I can about the world, and that is the reason why I'm in ISM. I want to learn more about the Artificial Intelligence field, and the inner workings of it. For the last couple of weeks, we have been working on building our personal brands.

The reason I bring up who I am and what I stand for is that I have been working on expressing myself effectively through my brand image. In the last three weeks, I have created this website for my digital portfolio, a resume cataloging all of my skills, and a LinkedIn profile to allow for professionals to contact me. Overall, I'm pretty proud of how everything turned out because there is a consistent color scheme and a simplistic theme.

However, now comes the difficult part. I need to start looking for ways to increase my contacts in the Artificial Intelligence field. My father is a Software Engineer at a company, but he doesn't personally know anyone in the Artificial Intelligence field. This means that I will most likely have to make a ton of cold calls to increase my list of contacts, and I personally do not enjoy doing that. I'm a pretty introverted person, meaning that it is usually tough for me to come out of my shell and let other people meet the actual me. I tend to be polite and professional with new people that I meet, which results in those new people not actually finding out about my personality. However, the purpose of the ISM program is to learn and practice being professional, and these cold calls will be extremely helpful. Overall, I'm really excited to learn more about the Artificial Intelligence field, and I can't wait to see where this program leads me!
