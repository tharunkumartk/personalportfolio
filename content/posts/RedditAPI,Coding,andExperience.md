Coding is so much fun.

The past week, I have been focusing on getting back into Python, particularly working with APIs. For my Final Product, I needed to obtain access to the text information in social media platforms across the internet. My first idea was to traditionally web scrape the information off of each website, but I quickly realized that it would become a time-consuming, tedious process. However, I found several online APIs for accessing these social media platforms, including the Reddit API. It is known for being difficult to work with, so I decided to try to utilize it in sample projects. Its reputation did not lie; the API is extremely intricate, requiring excessive work from the coder�s end. However, I eventually figured it out, and created my own text-based version of Reddit, that is able to post and view other people�s posts.

In addition, I managed to land an interview with one of my friends� dad. He works with Python in Machine Learning for his company, and the insight he provided at the ISM Business Symposium was eye-opening. Also, I finally completed my college application for Georgia Tech, Princeton, and UT Austin. I can�t wait for the interview to ask questions about his work in Natural Language Processing, and more importantly, I can�t wait to finish my Original Work.
