We’re back. 

This is now my second year in ISM, and I am more than excited to explore the field of Artificial Intelligence once again. However, this year, I am planning on exploring applications of AI in the medical field. I had a similar goal at the beginning of last year, but I realized the impracticality of doing medical research during a global pandemic. Although COVID-19 still persists to this day, the country as a whole has reduced the lockdown significantly. As a result, exploring the medical field is a real possibility this year.

In terms of mentorship, I’m not completely sure about whether I will keep my virtual mentorship from last year, or if I will reach out and find a new mentorship. But, what I do know is that I am planning on reaching out to medical professionals for interviews so that I can get a better idea of the field and the applications of Computer Science in the field. 

Last week, I focused on surface level research to determine what area of the medical field I would start with, and I arrived at Neuroscience. I hope to use the power of Natural Language Processing to make a meaningful impact in neuroscience. I came up with several research and interview questions for the field, so that I can have a pathway guiding my research for the next few weeks.
