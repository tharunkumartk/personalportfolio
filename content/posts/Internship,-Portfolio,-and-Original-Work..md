I grew up this week.

I managed to (potentially) land a Computer Science internship by networking through a couple of my dad’s colleagues. I ended up completing a real Software Engineering job application online, similar to what a professional would do in the real world. The process is surprisingly simple, despite how intimidating it seems. The internship is for college students, but the person I reached out to told me that he’d see what he could do. 

In addition to the internship application, I came up with ideas for my Original Work. After completing my third Research Assessment for this year, I realized that I wanted to create a program that used the vast array of text data across the internet and social media platforms. I want to explore the field of Neuroscience with AI, so this program would attempt to pre-diagnose certain mental illnesses. 

The final assignment that I worked on this week is my portfolio. I learned a lot about Javascript and front end development, allowing me to continue progressing my portfolio. I just need to finish the actual content and implement a blog onto the website, and I will be finished with my portfolio.

Things are looking good right now, and I am extremely excited for my Original Work.
