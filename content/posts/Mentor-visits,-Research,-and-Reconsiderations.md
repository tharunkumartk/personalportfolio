This week was one of my most intense weeks school-wise throughout the entire year. I had a ton of work to do for every single class, but I managed to get completely caught up on ISM (read previous blog posts for more information). However, over the weekend, a crazy winter storm hit Texas hard, resulting in several power outages across the state. My neighborhood had it pretty bad; we had power for 30 minutes before it cut out for up to 3 hours. As a result, I was unable to have my first mentor visit until Thursday, but the wait was worth it.

Our visit was extremely productive. I started the call hoping to explain what we exactly do in ISM, and we ended up having very in depth conversations about my potential Final Product. It turns out that he spent a decent amount of time in the health-side of Data Science, which is exactly what I want my Final Product to deal with. He explained to me that substantial research is required on the advantages and disadvantages of a potential Product before I completely dip my foot into the idea. However, we decided on the topic of early disease detection, which is what I will spend a majority of my time researching. He also showed me a really good repository with an extremely large amount of free public data. The website is data.gov, and it changed my perspective on data collection. 

With this information, I realized that it would be most wise to create my Final Product based on data I find in the repository.
