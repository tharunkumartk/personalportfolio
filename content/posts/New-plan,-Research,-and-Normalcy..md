This week, I did a lot of research in order to determine my Final Product, and I decided to drift away from the medical side of data science. This is because there isnâ€™t much free public data relating to early diagnosis, which makes a Final Product in that field difficult. Instead, I want to focus on renewable energy.


My current plan is to formulate a new system of power for the United States that allows for maximum utilization of renewable resources while minimizing implementation expenses. In the long run, renewable resources are what will keep the United States surviving, so it is a good idea to switch as soon as possible. My plan is to use population density data graphs, climate data graphs, energy use data graphs, and geography data graphs to split the United States into regions that can be powered by the most efficient combination of energy sources. For example, a city surrounded by relatively flat rural land would be perfect for wind power, while a different city in proximity of disposal facilities would be best suited for nuclear power plants. 

I still need to do more research into this, however, to determine if this idea is feasible given the amount of resources, time, and knowledge that I have.
