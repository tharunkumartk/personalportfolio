Databases aren’t as hard as I thought.

Last year, my four member website team won Third Place in BPA Nationals. It is a nation-wide competition with professional judges that view our website and presentations, so it was an amazing achievement. This year, we are planning to compete in the same event, but we want to win 1st place. We plan on expanding our website to have a real SQL database, and due to the Data Science skills I learned in ISM, I am in charge of implementing it. I didn’t realize it, but the hours of research and coding made a task like this a lot easier than expected. I had all of the tools and knowledge to construct, design, and establish a database for user log-ins, blog posts, and other information. This is an ongoing project, but it directly relates to my studies in ISM.

I also re-established extensive contact with my previous mentor. It seems that he is doing well, and I plan on connecting with him for another interview next week. We never talked about Natural Language Processing during the mentorship, so I hope to learn more about that field from him. Although I have become relatively independent in completing coding projects like my Original Work, there is always an opportunity to learn more. 

For my Original Work, I focused on structuring the Reddit data I obtained last week. In order to do this, I had to come up with a separate classification algorithm to classify useful posts from other topics. It is still a work-in-progress, but I have a general logical understanding of what I have to do. I think I will be much more prepared for completing my Original Work on time than the previous year.
