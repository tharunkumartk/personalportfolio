Connections make a difference.

I finally scheduled my first interview with an Artificial Intelligence Specialist. I was able to get his contact information from one of my friends, Shreyas Kumar. I originally found him through the ISM Business Symposium, but upon viewing his LinkedIn, I realized he was my friend, Shreyas's dad. Some of the information he provided at the symposium opened my eyes to how AI is used in business. It is scheduled for next week.

I also have an interview with a Princeton Graduate aerospace engineer in two weeks. This interview is for my admission into Princeton, but I hope I can utilize it for more than just that. My friend Dhruv Roy tells me a lot about work done in aerospace engineering, and it makes me realize how useful AI would be in the field. I am excited to discuss opportunities of AI in engineering with this professional, especially because of his rigorous research and educational background.

This week, I also learned effective text classification utilizing the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) in Python. I am excited to apply this new skill on my Original Work moving forward.
