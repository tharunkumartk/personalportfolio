This week in ISM, I went back to the roots of my curiosity: why did I want to explore the career of Artificial Intelligence?

This week in ISM, I went back to the roots of my curiosity: why did I want to explore the career of Artificial Intelligence?

I realized that the main reason I want to go into the field of Artificial Intelligence is because of the thought of computers being able to think like humans. At my current skill level, it’s almost impossible to imagine coding a program that is able to pick up on patterns in data to create algorithms. That’s why the idea of computers learning based on previous data to predict the future is mind boggling. That is the true reason why I want to explore this career; I want to understand how it all works.

I also researched some more this week; I focused on the topic of how analyzing data works. Artificial Intelligence depends heavily on data analysis, and in fact, there is an entire field known as “Data Science” that focuses on this subject. I learned that Artificial Intelligence formulates algorithms based on data by noticing patterns in large sets of data and refining a set of rules. For example, let’s take a program that is supposed to figure out if a picture is a dog or a cat. At first, the program will have no idea and simply guess. But, after it gets some correct guesses and incorrect guesses, it will have a general idea of what a picture of a cat looks like compared to a dog. That’s actually how humans learn things; they learn through trial and error. That’s why data analysis is so important: it serves as the fundamental foundation of Artificial Intelligence.

I hope to begin working on some personal projects that focus on creating programs like the example described earlier.
