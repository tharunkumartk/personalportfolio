I suck at making decisions.

On Monday last week, I discovered that the application for Texas A&M’s Early Action Engineering (and Computer Science) program was due on Friday, and I was freaking out. I hadn’t started my supplemental essays for that university and I only had five days to fully finish them while keeping up with Marching Band and my school classes. The only reason I wanted to apply for Early Action was because one of my friends told me that I needed to do Early Action for a specific scholarship. 

Throughout the week, I had focused on finishing up all of my supplements and Personal Statement so that I can make my submission on time. However, once Friday came along, I decided to call TAMU to confirm that Early Action was required for certain scholarships. I found out that it wasn’t actually required, and that I was freaking out over essentially nothing. Throughout this experience of stress and sleep deprivation, I learned to stop trusting everyone for important information, and to do research on my own. 

I still managed to squeeze in some time for ISM; I did a lot of coding and working with the AI libraries required to complete my Original Work, and I realized the true difficulty of accessing all of the text and information from reddit. I needed to come up with an algorithm to effectively absorb data across the internet from any website. I guess that’s what my last-year mentor meant when he said “finding and sifting the data is the most important part”. 

Things will only get busier from here due to college applications, but I hope to get time to continue working on this project.
