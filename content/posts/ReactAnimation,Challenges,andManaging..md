I have a new respect for front-end development.

During this week, my primary focus has been to complete my Final Product, which is an interactive website that allows users to upload their own data files to construct Neural Networks. The website also shows a visual demonstration of the Neural Network learning, and descriptions of each step. The purpose of the website is to inform non-technical users how Artificial Intelligence works. So far, I have completed the Neural Network creation API, the file-upload system, and a very basic website that works for basic Neural Network construction. However, I still have to make the website interactive and good-looking, which was what I focused on this week. 

My goal is to visualize each individual neuron of the Neural Network to learn, with arrows highlighting as data passes through the neuron. In other words, I have a very specific plan that I wish to implement. However, I have never done this sort of dynamic animation before, and I also do not have much experience with React. I have spent nearly 4 hours over the last two days just watching videos in hopes of mastering the concept, but it seems that there will be a lot of content that I will have to learn, since nobody has constructed anything like my Final Product before. I hope to complete it this weekend, but due to Band, I might be extremely busy, so we will see. Iâ€™m excited to see what I end up completing.
