This week, I continued working on my Original Work. I am coding it in Python, and I’m testing various models to see how they fundamentally work. However, before fully finishing the Original Work, I wanted to create a different program that focused on data collection and analysis. This program is essentially a deal tracker, where you can type in the keyword of the product that you want to find deals on, and the program searches through various websites to return deals. The reason I wanted to create this new program is because it helps me gain confidence in my ability to utilize data to determine predictions. The strength of a deal is determined by the past prices of the product. For example, if the product has been on sale several times in the past month for the same price, the deal is not a very good deal. However, if the new price is the first time it has ever been that low, the program determines it to be a good deal.

The only drawback of this week is that I am still extremely behind on my research and interview assessments. However, I am planning on completing these assessments tomorrow and my Original Work during Thanksgiving Break. Overall, I need to take more initiative and get ahead on all my work so that I don’t fall behind in the future.
