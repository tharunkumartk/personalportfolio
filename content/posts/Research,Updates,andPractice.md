The world keeps spinning. 

This was the primary realization that I had throughout this week. After a short three months of summer break, I did not expect there to be a great increase in advances in the Artificial Intelligence field, but after doing research throughout this week, I discovered the opposite. AI is becoming significantly more viable everyday, and it is my job to keep up with the industry.

In addition to research in the overall AI field, I further poked into the current applications of AI in neuroscience. I discovered that the power of basing prediction on large amounts of data is especially applicable in the realm of mental diseases. It is quite difficult for therapists and psychiatrists to perfectly and accurately diagnose their patients because, despite their rigorous education, they don’t have direct and quick access to all of the data that a computer does. 

Learning about this excited me because I felt that I could make real advancement in this field. I will have to continue learning the process of Natural Language Processing in order to effectively pursue a project in this subject, but I have decided that I want my first interview to be with a therapist/psychiatrist because I have more questions for them than someone in AI.
