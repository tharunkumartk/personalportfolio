All science is at its core just math. 

For my senior year math class, I am taking AP Statistics. The amount of connections that I have made between Statistical Data Analysis and Artificial Intelligence is mind-boggling. For example, currently we are learning the concept of Chi Squared Test as a way to determine significance, and I realized that this method is the same way certain Neural Networks work. This is especially useful, because after making this connection, I found so many new ways to apply my Statistics knowledge to solve Artificial Intelligence problems. 

In the past week, I also attended Dallas for a BPA State competition in SQL Database Fundamentals (I ended up winning first in the state and advancing to Nationals). But, more importantly, I managed to make a connection with a business professional there who handled the Java and SQL back-end for her start-up. We had a conversation, and she seemed incredibly impressed with my knowledge about Data Science, and offered to recruit me, under the impression that I was a college student. I explained to her that I was actually in high-school, and she told me I could still reach out to her in hopes of an internship or something of the sorts. I sent her an email a couple days ago following up, but she has not replied yet. I am excited to see how this goes.
