I forgot how fun giving speeches is.

At the start of my ISM journey, I was incredibly uneasy with the idea of delivering speeches, especially from memory. However, after each speech, I became more comfortable with it, and now it's to a point where I enjoy delivering these speeches. I am incredibly excited for the Final Presentation Night, because I can finally show off all of the skills that I’ve been working on throughout the year. While updating my slideshow, I found myself very nostalgic thinking about where I started this year, and how far I had come. Luckily, with just one rehearsal speech, I got to about 30 minutes, which is perfect for the presentation.

In addition, I finally made my college decision: I'm going to Princeton! As exciting as the opportunity is, I can’t help but feel scared for the future. I’ll be moving to a new location surrounded by new (and super smart) people, and it’s just scary to think about. I am really excited to research Computer Science applications in Medicine and Biology though. In fact, these research opportunities are what ended up making me choose Princeton over UT Austin. There is much yet to come, and I can’t tell if I’m anxious or excited.
