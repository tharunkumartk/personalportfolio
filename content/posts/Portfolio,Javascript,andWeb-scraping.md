The widespread applications of Data Science continues to astound me.

This week, I continued my focus on completing my custom-coded portfolio. I’ve finally finished it, and you (the reader) are most likely viewing this blog post on the updated portfolio. This personal project is something that I am incredibly proud of, primarily due to the large amount of time I spent learning Javascript and React on-the-fly. The Javascript objects of each element on the website was a concept that I had never heard of before; all of my Graphical User Interface experience had been with Java and Python, where there was much less complexity. However, after watching a couple videos and experimenting myself, I got the hang of it, and was able to implement my very own blog into this website. 

One of the trickiest parts of implementing the blog was to come up with a concise method of creating a new page for each blog post. Ordinarily, each page requires its own Javascript file, but I thought that it would be somewhat redundant to have multiple files with almost the exact same content. Instead, I realized I could iterate through all of the blog post files, and create new pages from a pre-existing template. I also had to extract all of the blogs from my old website. This would’ve taken an incredibly large amount of time if it weren’t for my Data Science experiment: I was able to automate copying and pasting the blogs from my old website to my new one, saving me nearly 4 hours of time. The following week, however, I plan to shift my focus from my personal projects and portfolio to finally finding a mentor. I can’t wait to see what’s next.
