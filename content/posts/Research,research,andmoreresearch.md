Over the last week, I focused on completing research for my Original Work, because it requires a great deal of knowledge to perfect.

I learned about the various models that can be used to analyze DNA effectively from electromagnetic microscopic pictures. In fact, there was a research paper published discussing the application of Artificial Intelligence in a medical context. The study analyzed the effects of certain types of light on DNA, and a Machine Learning program was used to figure out how the DNA was affected by light. The source code for this program was released onto the publication, and I was able to look through it to thoroughly understand how it works. It utilized a number of models that combined helped figure out the DNA structure.

Using this information, I thought about how I could analyze the actual nucleotides of the DNA and calculate the overall DNA structure. Other than this research, I attempted to contact more people, but no one was able to schedule an interview with me. This week, I will have to contact even more people, and hopefully schedule multiple more interviews.
