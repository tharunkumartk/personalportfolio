The last week has been extremely busy for me; I’ve had to balance ACT preparation, schoolwork, and some family issues. But, I still managed to come up with a solid idea for my Final Product. 

My plan is to create a cancer prediction algorithm based on symptoms. I am planning on using a Support Vector Machine to sift through filled out surveys by real cancer patients describing their symptoms. In order to obtain the filled out surveys, I will contact cancer treatment facilities across the nation, explaining what I am doing. The survey will be in the form of a google form, and it will include a box for the type of cancer they have along with a rating of the symptoms they experienced before treatment. The final product will use all of this data to create an algorithm that can predict the type of cancer based on the symptoms. 

To accomplish this final product, I will need to do hefty research on how doctors predict cancers based on symptoms. The reason this is best suited for an Artificial Intelligence program is because the program will learn based on every new entry, continually perfecting its algorithm.
