Interviews stress me out.

That’s right, I said it. Interviews. Stress. Me. Out. I don’t know what it is about interviews. Maybe it’s the fear of messing up and losing the opportunity that I had worked so hard to build up to? Or maybe it’s the lack of knowledge about what the interviewer is going to ask? Perhaps it's the thought of getting interviewed by a completely random person? I’m not sure, but whatever it is sure gets the better of me. 

This entire week, I have been preparing and practicing for the interviews that we are having on Monday. These interviews do not serve any “real” meaning; they’re mainly to gain knowledge and connections. But, I still want to practice and master the skill of being interviewed, because it’s an essential skill in the professional workplace. The main thing I did to improve was too cold call random companies. Although it doesn’t prepare me for the actual interview, it allows me to get used to talking to random people and making up stuff off the top of my head. It also gets me used to speaking in a polite, professional manner. And, believe it or not, after doing all this practice with random people, I feel sort of ready for the interviews. 

In addition to preparing for the interviews and cold calling, I began getting back into Python (the ideal programming language for Artificial Intelligence). I started creating these things called “Monitors” that essentially update the user with updates of prices/good deals on certain websites. In order to do this, I had to refresh my knowledge on web scraping and the overall Python programming language. 

I’m planning on beginning my first main Artificial Intelligence project next week. I want to create a machine learning program that can recognize patterns over a set of numbers. For example, you feed in a series of approximately 20 numbers, and the program should be able to recognize the equation from one number to the next. 

I guess we’ll just have to see what next week will look like.
