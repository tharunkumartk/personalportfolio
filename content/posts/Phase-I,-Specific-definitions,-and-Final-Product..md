This week, I am planning on finishing phase 1 of my Final Product, since I completed almost all of my research. I have to express the problem that I am trying to solve with words, with specific, calculable definitions for all of my terms. For example, if I say “the energy source with the least carbon footprint”, I would have to define a method of determining carbon footprint numerically for every single energy source. This may seem like an easy job, but after attempting to work on it for a while, I realized the difficulty of the job. The difficulty primarily comes from the specificity that the definitions must abide by. 

In addition, I am planning on having a mentor visit on Friday to discuss how my first phase went, and for guidance on my second phase. This means that I HAVE to finish my first phase before Friday, which is pretty doable. Thankfully, I decided to not take the SAT on Wednesday, instead opting to take it in the summer (I have already taken it twice and gotten a good-enough score). 

I am excited to see how everything plays out this week, particularly with my Final Product.
