I have begun working on my Original Work, and I did not realize how difficult it would be until actually attempting it. My Original Work involved the creation of an Artificially Intelligent program that was able to analyze pictures of DNA and determine what organism the DNA belonged to. The primary problem that I am dealing with is the interaction between the computer and the actual pictures. I am still attempting to devise an algorithm to convert the pictures of the DNA to information that the computer can read. After all, it’s smooth sailing after that.

What I am most likely going to do is modify my Original Work plan; instead of coding the complete program, I will create a data structure to store the DNA information, and using various samples of information in the data structure, the program will determine the organism that the DNA belongs to. I’m hoping that I am able to figure out the actual code for converting the DNA images into readable data over winter break, but as of right now, this will be my Original Work.
