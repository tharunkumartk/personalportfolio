This was the week of my first real interview.

As I mentioned in one of my earlier blog posts, meeting new people is scary for me, especially in an interview setting. Therefore, a ton of practice is required for me to maintain a professional composure. The main ways I practiced included talking to a mirror about Artificial Intelligence, ISM, and asking it questions. This method may not benefit some people, but it definitely helped me. Because of this practice, I was able to speak without stammering due to nervousness. 

The overall interview went extremely well in my opinion. My business professional was a Data Scientist, and he helped answer some of the broader questions that I had. I learned about what the future of Artificial Intelligence looked like, along with the logistics of coding in a team setting. I realized the importance of meaningful names and API in code; they are important because other people have to be able to understand your code in order to add/utilize it. 

He also showed some of the applications of Artificial Intelligence in a medical context. An example was the program deployed in Mumbai, India that analyzed the voices of sick patients to diagnose them with COVID-19. This caught my attention because it showed how Artificial Intelligence can abuse certain side effects of diseases to diagnose patients, which further helps with my Original Work.

Generally, I think my first interview went extremely well, and I hope for my future interviews to be even better.
