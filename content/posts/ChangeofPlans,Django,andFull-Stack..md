Plans are meant to be changed. 

My original Final Product was to utilize a form of Machine Learning known as Photogrammetry, where a program utilizes a Neural Network and large amounts of data to map 2D figures onto a 3D model. However, after large amounts of research, I found two potential pathways: I could implement a highly efficient Neural Network that has already been created, where I would not be creating any new algorithms on my own, or I could create a new algorithm that will more than likely be less efficient than the industry standard, and therefore redundant. I didn’t like either of these options, so I decided to scrap the idea.

Instead, after tinkering with full-stack development in an Evidence of Learning, I knew I wanted to master this skill. As a result, I decided to create a web application that can create a Neural Network on any data provided. The program would also create the predictions for any new data. This would be a client-friendly website, allowing users without Machine Learning knowledge to make predictions using their data. I plan on utilizing a Python framework known as Django and a Javascript framework known as React to develop this web application. I have already completed the back-end difficulty of the project over the weekend, so all that’s left is developing an elegant front-end application. I’m disappointed in changing my project so last-minute, but I believe it will be worth the skills that I will end up learning.
