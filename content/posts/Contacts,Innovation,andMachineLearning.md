We had the Business Symposium this week, and I don’t think it went too bad.

For my interview, I got paired up with a speech therapist (someone completely unrelated to my field). But, (with the help of my professional) I was able to make the best of the situation and still learned a lot about the professional world. She helped me realize that I needed to start planning and figuring out the career pathway to get to my field. In addition, she explained what the pre-professional world was like. But the best resource that she gave me was contact with a professional in my field. This person works at a professional video game creation company as a game designer. This is relevant to my field because he often deals with the team-working aspect of Artificial Intelligence, which is a topic that I have several questions about. I will be contacting him, among many others this week.

In addition, we had to create an Original Work Proposal that detailed a product that displayed the research that we did this year. I came up with an invention that makes an extremely beneficial change to the world while being plausible with my skill caliber. I cannot detail the invention in this post because it might actually be able to be patented. 

On top of that, we had to do some research about a new topic this week. I learned about the main method that machines actually learn: neural networks. These networks are essentially the strategic usage of “nodes” and weighted “synapses” that connect and develop based on the amount of information provided. As more and more data is given to the program, the program becomes increasingly accurate.

This week I plan on beginning my research on my Original Work, while also contacting some of the people on my contact list and possibly scheduling interviews.
