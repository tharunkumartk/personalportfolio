This week, I mainly researched and worked on my research speech. 

The primary topic that I researched this week was the positives and negatives of various Machine Learning models. These models are what the program uses to learn based on previous data. Learning when to use these models is incredibly important because they play a major role in the efficiency of an Artificial Intelligence program. Allowing an AI program to learn using test data uses an incredible amount of resources, so it’s ideal to have an already efficient program before running it. 

Since no one was responding to my emails and phone calls, I decided to focus on my research presentation and attempt to find interviews next week. I didn’t realize how much I’ve learned over the course of ISM until creating this presentation. When I first recorded it, the speech ended up being a good 5 minutes more than I had expected it to be. This made me feel better about the hour-long presentation that we have to give at the end of the year; it showed that talking about something that I was passionate about was actually pretty easy. 

Next week, no matter what, I am dead set on finding at least 3 more interviews.
