Easy weeks are unproductive.

Easy weeks are unproductive.

The past week was relatively laid back due to the PSAT. I was mainly focused on studying for this national test because it is vital for college scholarships in the future. If I somehow managed to become a National Merit Semi-Finalist, the pathway to becoming an Artificial Intelligence becomes far clearer. The main blockade for going to certain colleges is the extreme cost, so scholarships would be helpful.

As a result, in ISM, I did not do much. I mainly focused on gathering contacts for potential interviews and mentors. I managed to find a Data Scientist that lived in my neighborhood who was in the same friend group as my father. Crazy, right? I have set up an interview with him later this week, and he may potentially become my mentor. If not, I have over 15 other contacts to ask.

There’s not much else that I did this week. I am sort of disappointed that I was unable to do any research for my Original Work until this week due to the PSAT, but it’s time to get back on the grind.
