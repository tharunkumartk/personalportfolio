This week I finished Stage 2 of my Final Product, which is creating the equations for each power source. I decided on making my objective function (the function that I try to minimize with the given constraints) based on the carbon dioxide produced by each energy source. I had to go with a couple assumptions, however. I assumed the dimensions of the average windmill, water turbine, and solar panel when calculating the energy produced per utility. Once I determined these assumptions, I also decided on using an average CO2 produced per Watt-hour energy as my “C” factor, and whenever that multiplies with everything in the function, you end up with just CO2. 

I also planned out how I would map out the actual regions for the energy sources, deciding on a sort of “puzzle piece” technique. It’s a little complicated to explain, but in the end, I will just combine the puzzle piece regions that I had acquired to create regions.

This week, I will be focused on finding datasets for each energy source (I’m doing Coal, Natural gas, Hydroelectricity, Wind power, and Solar power) to plug into the functions. I addition, I will most likely have to come up with another function for creating a topographic map for each dataset, so that I have the data at any point in Texas. After that, it’s simple minimization (learned in Stage 0) and producing a visual representation to finish my Final Product. 

I’m excited.
