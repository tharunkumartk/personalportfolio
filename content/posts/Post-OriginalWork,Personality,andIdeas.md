Imagine a computer able to think.

This idea is what led me to explore the field of Artificial Intelligence, and this week I finally researched how viable this idea truly is in the real world, and I was not disappointed. I explored a project known as “Luka” that is a recreated personality of one of the creator’s closest friends. It is able to communicate empathetically with its users while staying similar to the person that it is recreating. My mind was blown by how such technology exists in the current world, but the project got me thinking: what if the computer was able to analyze more than just textual interaction between people; what if it could analyze brain waves and signals to understand and replicate a human brain’s thoughts?

This idea would not only be otherworldly, but somewhat possible. The emerging bridge between Neuroscience and Artificial intelligence is one that has immense potential, and I can’t wait to continue exploring the idea in future Research Assessments. For my Final Product, I hope to create something in the field, but I need more research in how Neuroscience works. I’m considering reaching out to professionals in Neuroscience to get a better understanding of the depth of the field, so that I can utilize it in Artificial Intelligence. I’m so excited.
