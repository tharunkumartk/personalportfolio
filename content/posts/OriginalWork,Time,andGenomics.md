I completely started my Original Work this week, and oh my. 

I realized how truly difficult my updated Original Work would be, considering my lack of knowledge in Genomics. After all, I am trying to create an API for DNA analysis that can be used by several other programs. The API contains several methods and a data structure for creating DNA objects. The methods allow geneticists to analyze populations using the DNA. However, the difficult part is actually implementing and determining what models to use, especially without much understanding at how geneticists analyze DNA data. 

As a result, I have spent the bulk of the last week researching DNA sequencing and analysis. I have learned about DNA Barcoding, and the types of DNA used for each type of analysis. I hope that I am able to successfully finish this project, because it would not only be helpful to the community, but it would also be incredibly beneficial to my resume.
