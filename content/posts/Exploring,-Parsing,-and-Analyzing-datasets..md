After getting my Final Product approved my Mrs. Altizer, I began doing extensive research on how to approach the solution for my Final Product. I began by trying to figure out what data I needed to complete my Final Product. I realized that I needed to first figure out what geographical attributes make a location ideal for each energy source that I am planning on implementing. 

Once I figured out what data I needed, I began looking for actual datasets on data.gov. I realized that I didnâ€™t quite fully understand how to access the data on data.gov, so it was quite a learning experience. There were file formats that I had never worked with before, like .csv and .tar.gz, but once I figured it all out, I was able to look through my first dataset. I looked through a dataset that described the average sunlight radiance and hours, and a lot more information, across the United States over the last 20 years. This dataset was very extensive, with over 1 million entries, so it took a while for my Python program to parse through it. 

Throughout this experience, I learned how to effectively analyze datasets, and this will prove to be extremely useful for future datasets and my Final Product.
