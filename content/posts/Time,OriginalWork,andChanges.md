Things are getting busy again.

Marching Band is getting busy again, and I知 having trouble keeping up. Last week was especially difficult; we had 52 hours of rehearsal/performances on top of school hours, which is bizarre. As a result, I wasn稚 able to fit in a lot of my ISM work, including my Research Assessment #4, so I am already extremely behind on my work. My goal for at least the beginning of this year is to get consistent with completing my work at a reasonable time, rather than procrastinating a lot of it like year. 

However, I still managed to get a bit of work done in class. We did a peer-editing activity in class that really gave me insight into my Original Work idea. Currently, my plan is to use the social media platform, Reddit, to analyze and create a Neural Disorder Machine Learning Model that is able to predict your mental state based on the tone and word usage of your conversations. Although this sounds unrealistic, researchers from MIT and several other universities created models similar to this with outstanding success. However, my peers in my class pointed out the ethical concerns with this type of program, and I realized that there would be a lot of issues with this idea. 

Currently, I知 not dead set on proceeding with this plan, so I will do more research into the ethical dilemmas and accuracies of programs like this. This week, I plan to catch up on the work that I知 behind on, and perhaps over the 4-day weekend, I can get ahead.
