In the last week, I learned about what Support Vector Machines were. This was a very large concept to wrap my head around because it involved multidimensional calculus. This classification algorithm would be most fitting for my Final Product because it can take multiple dimensions as input (different questions on the form) and can classify into several different classes (perfect for the multiple different cancers). The best part is that the process requires relatively little data! This is because of how the algorithm is structured: it’s based on creating a sort of “line of best fit” around the data to separate it. 

I also learned how to implement this algorithm into various test cases using Python. It turns out that most algorithms are incredibly easy to implement; it’s just difficulty picking the most efficient ones and understanding the math behind them. 

The next week, I am planning on researching the intricacies with predicting cancers using symptoms. I had a goal at the beginning of this year to not fall behind, but I’m starting to fail that goal. I am behind by about a week due to extraneous circumstances, but I have decided that this week I will catch up on all of it.
