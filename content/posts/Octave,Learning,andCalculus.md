This week, I focused on starting my Final Product, especially since all of the work that I had done prior to this was learning and practice to prepare for my Final Product. I have decided to use a free alternative to MATLAB to complete all of my mathematical optimization in Stage 4. The application that I decided on using is called Octave, and it seems to do all of the same functions as MATLAB, even reading .m files. 

I have also been learning a lot of Operations Research from a book my mentor recommended to me: “Engineering Optimization Theory and Practice” by Rao. It’s a very straightforward book, and the strategies that are described are incredibly intuitive, making the textbook somewhat enjoyable. My interest in Calculus and my interest in Data Science are both being taken care of with this book, because optimization involves a large amount of calculus.

I also had a mentor visit last Friday to discuss future steps after Stage 1. He gave me some advice with my English translation, and once I implement his advice, I will be ready to progress to stage 2 of my Final Product.

The next week, I hope to finish stage 2 of my Final Product, which is coming up with the mathematical expressions to represent my problem, along with some data analysis to complete the constants in the mathematical expressions.
