Maybe animation is not so easy.

Last week, I thought I had figured out the animation through CSS; however, I quickly realized that it wasn't just that easy. There is a lot that goes into custom animation of objects, especially when the objects depend on API calls from the back-end. In other words, the number of input nodes depends directly on the data that the user provides, meaning that animating the nodes accurately requires an advanced understanding of Javascript, which I just don't have yet. However, I ended up settling on leaving the animation out for when it comes to Final Presentation Night, because I simply would not have enough time to complete it well. 

For the first time so far, I was limited in not just time, but also knowledge in implementing a project. I hope that, in the future, I manage my time much better and learn the required skills for projects quicker. A lot of the first part of this semester was spent relaxing, and when the end of the semester came along, it became incredibly stressful. I really regret not using my time wisely earlier, because I might have been able to complete my vision for my Final Product. I am excited for my presentation though!
