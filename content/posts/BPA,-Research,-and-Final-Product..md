This week I did not spend much time on ISM, because I had my BPA state competitions. 

The reason I talk about my BPA state competitions here is because they are somewhat related to my field; my individual event is SQL Database Fundamentals, which is essentially about how data is stored in relational database systems. Through engaging studying, I was able to get third in state and advance to the national level in competition. In addition, I was in a group event where we had to create a website based on a given prompt. In that event, we had the #1 best website in the state, and advanced to the national level.

For our website, at regionals, we got dead last place. The only reason we advanced to state is because, by a stroke of luck, there were too few people that advanced to state. After facing failure, we realized the true amount of work we all needed to put in for success. So, we worked, and worked, and worked, and we ultimately pulled through with 1st place at state. That's right; we went from dead last in regionals to 1st place at state. From that moment on, I learned the true value of hard work.

The time I spent on ISM was spent researching energy solutions for my Final Product. I also talked to Mrs. Altizer discussing the plausibility of my Final Product, and we came to a conclusion.
