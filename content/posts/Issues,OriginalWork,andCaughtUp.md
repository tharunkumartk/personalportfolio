Where did I go wrong?

A large portion of this week has been spent on perfecting my Neural Network for my project. One important caveat regarding it is that I can only work on it at home because my laptop (M1 Chip) does not support TensorFlow nor Keras, which is the framework that my project runs off of. As a result, I donï¿½t have much time to work on the project. In addition, for some reason, the Neural Network I created is not working. All of my data looks accurate, as well as the code and logic underlying the Neural Network, but the model is simply not training.

My leading suspicion is that my instantiation of the hidden layers in the Neural Network was not correct, so I am exploring that suspicion as of right now, but if that does not work, I will have to redo nearly a quarter of the project through a different Python module. However, the good news is that I was able to obtain all of my data, which came to nearly 15000 words with over 200 total entries. This means that, once I figure out where I went wrong, the model will be trained extremely well, allowing it to perform its best.
