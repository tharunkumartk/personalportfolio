Maybe Data Science is not my future.

From this Final Product, I am realizing that I do not want to completely become a Data Scientist. The reason I love the field so much has less to do with the data within it, and more to do with the Artificial Intelligence algorithms that can be used with the data. I want to ensure that I still practice Artificial Intelligence in my career, but for my actual occupation, I feel that Data Science may be extremely repetitive and boring. My Final Product is helping me realize this because of how tedious constructing the database for my Final Product is. 

I believe that a Full Stack engineer is more akin to what I hope to do in the future. I enjoy most parts of Computer Science, including both front-end and back-end, but there are certain parts of both that I dislike. As a full-stack engineer, I would be able to do primarily the tasks I like, while the front-end/back-end experts can handle the tedious tasks that I dislike. 

My Final Product is still a work in progress. I have finally figured out a method of implementing the animation, so all I have to do is create the CSS through React’s Styled-Components module, and combine everything together. However, I am definitely cutting it close, since Final Presentation Night is just around the corner. But, I’m excited to see how my future ends up playing out.
