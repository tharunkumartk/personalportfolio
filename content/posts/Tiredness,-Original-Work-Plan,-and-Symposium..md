I am tired.

This week was another busy one for Marching Band, and I was especially tired due to the previous week. However, this week was the Business Symposium event, and I am beyond proud of how I handled it. I learned a lot from the event, primarily because I was the main person out of my group asking questions (not many other people did, even when no one was talking). I was able to get two contacts of people that I believe will be extremely helpful. One actually works in Artificial Intelligence, and the other is the CEO of a company that does a lot of IT work. 

In addition, I worked on my Original Work. I created a semi-plan for how I would approach my Original Work: first, I needed a way to sift out all of the data I use to figure out whether a piece of text would be an example of a mental disorder, or not. It had to be automated, which means I needed to use Natural Language Processing technology to analyze the text to see if there are any direct claims made of having a certain mental illness. After that, I can put the data in a Convolutional Neural Network that learns based on this large amount of data. Finally, I can test it out using test-pieces of data to see the accuracy of the model. 

I am extremely excited for the rest of this week to be over, because I think that I will have a lot of free time. Due to PSAT, I will have a half-day, and itâ€™s already a four-day week, so perhaps I can get a head-start on my Original Work.
