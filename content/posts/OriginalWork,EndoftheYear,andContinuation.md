Last week, I focused and dedicated all of my free time to finishing my Original Work on time. I was successful in creating a python program that determined the species of a piece of DNA (the type of DNA depends on the type of organism). I was a little rusty with python, so a good chunk of my time was spent learning how to use the various modules required for this project. I learned how to read and write into spreadsheets (a necessary skill for the AI world), how to retrieve any data from any website (required a DNA database), and how to convert all of the data into usable forms in python. Overall, this Original Work helped me learn a lot about python while making a positive impact on the world.

For the rest of this week, I’m going to be focused on improving my Original Work so that it can do other statistical regressions and predictions with DNA.

This is going to be the last blog post of 2020, so I wanted to do some reflection on ISM this year. In the beginning of the year, I was on top of everything, but as SATs, PSATs, and band began to eat up a lot of time, I started falling behind. However, I managed to somewhat pick myself up towards the end of the semester. I hope that I can continue staying on top of everything for the next semester.
